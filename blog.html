                <h2>Why is the Uchiha Clan soo strong</h2>
                <p>*insert image*</p>
                <p>Naruto is one of if not the best anime I have ever watched and I'm not the only one who feels that way on various review platforms like MyAnimeList, IMDb, and etc, Naruto has a high overall rating typically ranging from 8.0 to 8.5 out of 10 and one thing that stood out for me was that the Uchiha clan are overpowered. After doing some research and re-watching some episodes, what I have noticed is that a fair amount of Naruto fans don't know how overpowered the memeber of this clan are, inorder to examine that we have to look at the Uchiha members whose story was more compelling and there are four clan members that fit the examination which are Sasuke, Itachi, Madara, Obito. Sauske Uchiha is one of the main characters along side the main character who the serie is named after "Naruto". Sasuke is particularly important because the creator(Masashi Kishimoto) gives a handful of chapters to Sasuke for the longest of time. Itachi Uchiha who is Sasuke elder brother, but what makes Itachi significant is that for the first parts of the serie killing Itachi is Sasuke's only goal which means Sasuke had to get very strong to kill Itachi and alot of plots and stories that revolved around their conflict. Madara Uchiha and Obito Uchiha are the serie final villians as a result they are both automatically important as Sauske and Itachi. One thing these members have in common is that the story requires them to be overpowered or else the serie won't be intersting and will break down. Sasuke is Naruto rival and inorder to beat your rival you have to be stronger than your rival, Itachi serves the same purpose for Sasuke. Mardara and Obito are overpowered for obviously one reason and that is being the final villiains of the story and fighting literally every ninja in the serie showed how strong they are, Madara and Obito had a couple of plot build up to live up to. These four members are extremly important to the story and thats why they are soo overpowered.</p>
